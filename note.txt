best practice advice from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ngCLZ5Iz-0&t=253s

FIRST:
 1- const count = useCounterStore((state) => state.count);
 2- const { count } = useCounterStore((state) => state);

1 is better then 2 , because in the 2 when every state value in the store change it render the components again 

SECOND:
 when you define your store group them by specifics features
 in our store the useCounterStore only focus on the count functionality it dosnt have another thing to do
 if we want to have extra functionality exemple auth we create another store call it useAuthStore 
  and store the state relate it to the auth
 that make it more moduler and you can have them in seperate files and for each components need specefic state
  will import it from that store and not from giga file contain all the states
 and it will make it easy to add functionalityto the app and easy to maintane
